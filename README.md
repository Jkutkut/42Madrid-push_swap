# push_swap:
The push_swap project is a sorting algorithm implementation project at 42School.
In this project, we will be sorting numbers on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
We will learn how to optimize an algorithm and how to choose the right data structure(s) for a problem.

## Compiling:
```
make
```

### Checker program:
```
make bonus
```

## Usage:
```
./push_swap [numbers]
```

### Checker program:
```
ARG="numbers"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

## Showcase:
- Clone the repository
- Run `make`
- Clone the tester inside the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:Jkutkut/42Tester-push_swap.git
```
- Run the visualizer:
```
./42Tester-push_swap/visualize.sh big
```

## Conclusion
The push_swap program is a challenging project that requires a deep understanding of algorithm implementation and optimization. By implementing this sorting algorithm from scratch, you improve your problem-solving skills and gain valuable experience in algorithm design.
